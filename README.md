Task is to train a simple linear regression model on given datasets and predict the output

Step-1: Read test_data and train_data csv files

Step-2:Drop rows which contain missing values

Step-3: Assign data as individual columns

Step-4: Creating a Linear Regression model

Step-5: Predict the output for train and test data

Step-6: Measure the performance of the model using Mean Squared error

Step-7: Measure the performance of the model using Mean Absolute error

Step-8: Measure the performance of the model using Root Mean Squared Error

Step-9: Plotting the predictions of test data using scatter plot

Step-10: Histogram of Residuals
